## Tech Stack 

Previous iterations of my site were made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This version is made using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) ( pulling from [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) and [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) ).
